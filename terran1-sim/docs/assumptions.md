# Assumptions & V&V Notes

Document all key assumptions, ranges, and references here.

- Vehicle geometry & masses: sources, ranges
- Engine thrust & Isp: sources, altitude corrections
- Atmosphere models: US Std Atm for mean, Earth-GRAM for dispersions
- Aero CFD: meshing strategy, turbulence model, y+ targets, validation notes
- Propulsion CFD: nozzle BCs, chamber/ambient pressure sweep
- Trajectory/GNC: constraints (Max-Q, accel), guidance logic
- Monte Carlo: dispersion tables, seeds, result summaries
